# Vue Shop Site
This is a full stack application using Vue in the front end and a Node/Express backend.  All data is stored in a MongoDB.

For more information on the front-end and back-end projects, see the readmes in their corresponding folders.

## Project Setup
You will have to run commands in each folder to install the necessary packages.

## Running Locally
Each project's readme has instructions on running the projects individually, or you can prepare and use the build version.

## Preparing a Build
The front end code is built and then copied into the back end folder to be deployed statically.

1. In the front-end folder run 
```
npm run build
```

2. Copy the dist folder from the front-end folder to the back-end folder
3. Once the changes are committed and pushed up, the changes will be published automatically
